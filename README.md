###Project Description

**_Music Recommendation Service for Exploring Artists and Sharing Music with People_**

Users will login with their Spotify accounts. They will be provided with a Search where they can specify an Artist. A list of their 5 most popular songs is displayed. Each of these songs can be sent to a chat room where there will be the same Search option. In this chat room, people will be sending songs to one another sharing their music preferences.

*Moonshot*: Play a preview of the songs and allow users to like the songs sent by others.
